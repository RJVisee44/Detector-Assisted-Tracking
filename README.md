# Detector-Assisted-Tracking

This repository introduces Detector-Assisted Tracking: a simple yet efficient and accurate combination between You Only Look Once (YOLO) version 2 (YOLOv2) and OpenCV online trackers (Median Flow (MF), Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF), Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), Online Boosting (OLB)).
